In this course work i learned alot to be fair, it was a hard experience for me but the programming module made it a little easier. the challanges i faced was me understanding the concept itself
one of the main challanges that made me suffer in this course work was the math involved, im not a maths person but i got the job done.
with consistency and hard work everything came apart and it looks good in the final result.
not using any AI websites also made it harder but i used AI in understaning the concept and outlining the work i did.
